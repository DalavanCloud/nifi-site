        <p>Apache NiFi welcomes the responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities. The NiFi team believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying
            weaknesses in any technology. If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you to notify us. We will work with you to resolve the issue
            promptly.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure Policy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.</li>
            <li>Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.</li>
            <li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit
                permission of the account holder.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exclusions</h3>
        <p>While researching, we'd like to ask you to refrain from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Denial of service</li>
            <li>Spamming</li>
            <li>Social engineering (including phishing) of Apache NiFi staff or contractors</li>
            <li>Any physical attempts against Apache NiFi property or data centers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reporting Methods</h3>
        <p>NiFi accepts reports in multiple ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:security@nifi.apache.org">security@nifi.apache.org</a>. This is a private list monitored by the <a href="people.html">PMC</a>. For sensitive
                disclosures, the GPG key fingerprint is <strong>1230 3BB8 1F22 E11C 8725 926A AFF2 B368 23B9 44E9</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>NiFi has a <a href="https://hackerone.com/apache_nifi" target="_blank">HackerOne</a> project page. HackerOne provides a triaged process for researchers and organizations to
                collaboratively report and resolve security vulnerabilities.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>CVE-2017-7665</b>: Apache NiFi XSS issue on certain user input components</p>
        <p>Severity: <b>Important</b></p>
        <p>Versions Affected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apache NiFi 0.0.1 - 0.7.3</li>
            <li>Apache NiFi 1.0.0 - 1.2.0</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Description: There are certain user input components in the Apache NiFi UI which had been guarding for some forms of XSS issues but were insufficient. </p>
        <p>Mitigation: The fix for more complete user input sanitization will be applied on Apache NiFi 0.7.4 and Apache NiFi 1.3.0 releases. Users running a prior 0.x or 1.x release should upgrade to
            the appropriate release. </p>

        <p>Description: Apache NiFi needs to establish the response header telling browsers to only allow framing with the same origin. </p>
        <p>Mitigation: The fix to set this response header will be applied on Apache NiFi 0.7.4 and Apache NiFi 1.3.0 releases. Users running a prior 0.x or 1.x release should upgrade to the
            appropriate release. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Description: In a cluster environment, if an anonymous user request is replicated to another node, the originating node identity is used rather than the “anonymous” user. </p>
        <p>Mitigation: A fix has been provided (removing the negative check for anonymous user before building the proxy chain and throwing an exception, and evaluating each user in the proxy chain
            iteration and comparing against a static constant anonymous user). This fix was applied in NIFI-3487 and released in Apache NiFi 0.7.2 and 1.1.2. 1.x users running a clustered environment
            should upgrade to 1.1.2. 0.x users running a clustered environment should upgrade to 0.7.2. Additional migration guidance can be found <a

        <p>Description: In a cluster environment, the proxy chain serialization/deserialization is vulnerable to an injection attack where a carefully crafted username could impersonate another user
            and gain their permissions on a replicated request to another node. </p>
        <p>Mitigation: A fix has been provided (modification of the tokenization code and sanitization of user-provided input). This fix was applied in NIFI-3487 and released in Apache NiFi 0.7.2 and
